# CSE 841 Project: Estimated Delivery Date Optimization

## Project Background:
Millions of packages get shipped out every day from international shipping providers (UPS, FedEx, USPS,
DHL, etc.). These multi-billion dollar companies are competing across many levels to satisfy the growing
demand of e-commerce. Their jobs are to deliver packages on time, to the right location, in a careful
manner to ensure the products arrive undamaged. These companies have a complex architecture that
runs their systems to ensure packages arrive at hubs and stations on time. Additionally, all scan data is
fed through queues and feeds and sent to different systems to ensure route manifests are printed the
day of shipment arrival, scanned in at the station, and put onto courier vans. A lot of these legacy
systems are dependent upon rule-based conditional logic that are implemented into the system
codebase to give an “estimated arrival delivery date”, or EADD. These rules need to be manually
updated and communicated across all down-stream systems when business processes change, making it
costly and human-dependent. In addition, a lot of variability is in place that the rules cannot possibly
account for, such as weather implications, packages that get lost/not transported out of the facilities or
delays due to staffing issues. Additionally, there is urbanized pressure due to the increase in congestion
on roadways and the lack of infrastructure to support curbside parking, making it harder to meet system
delivery estimates. One of the reasons package estimation spans across multiple days is due to these
changing dynamics that cannot be accounted for. When these delivery companies are delivering a
promise to provide overnight shipping, it is crucial they withhold this promise as it directly affects
customer retention and sales volume.

## Project Opportunity:
Simply giving an estimate on delivery time is no longer a key success factor when it comes to logistics
performance. Over-promising or under-promising are both undesirable in their own ways. That is why it
is now critical to use data-driven decisions to forecast package arrival dates, from the moment
customers view a product, to the point it arrives at their doorstep. Using machine learning methods and
predictive analytics, I will be exploring a variety of ways to achieve a more accurate delivery date
estimation.

Depending on the outcome of the project, this could lead to a proposal within FedEx that could lead to
further research and development. At minimum, this presents a great opportunity to explore the ongoing 
research in the field to help better predict estimated delivery time.
